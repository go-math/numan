// Package equidistant provides means for working with the Newtonâ€“Cotes grid.
//
// Each node in the grid is identified by a sequence of levels and orders. Such
// a sequence is encoded as a sequence of uint64s where each uint64 is
// (level|order<<6). Consequently, the maximal level is 2^6, and the maximal
// order is 2^58.
